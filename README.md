## About

The HCI Index is a curated guide to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literature, designed to make academic research accessible and engaging for designers and enthusiasts alike. It's a passion project aimed at distilling seminal HCI papers into simplified outlines, fostering understanding and sparking curiosity within the field.

## Motivation

This project was born from a fascination with the rich history and academic research behind HCI and interaction design. It aims to lower the barriers to accessing dense, technical academic literature, providing a starting point for those new to the field or looking for inspiration.

## Process & Tools

Developed using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, the site leverages Supabase for backend needs. AI, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, played a crucial role in suggesting influential papers and generating summaries. The project also experiments with semantic search to surface relevant content, demonstrating the potential of modern AI and full-stack development to enhance access to HCI knowledge.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's adding new summaries, improving existing content, or suggesting new features, your input helps make HCI Index a richer resource for everyone interested in the intersection of humans and technology.
